title: Event-Driven Architecture Reference Implementation
description: Event-Driven Architecture reference implementation.
---

As part of producing IBM best practice and reference architectures for event driven, we have brought together a complete scenario which covers all aspects of developing an event driven solution. The shipping business provides a good foundation for many of these concepts and enables us to show how to develop event driven solutions using some of the common architecture patterns.

The presentation and best practices are described in [separate repository](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/).
