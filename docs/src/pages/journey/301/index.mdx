## Security review - RBAC
## Producer advanced

In [this section](/technology/kafka-producers/#advanced-producer-discussion), we address how to support exactly once delivery
between producer and consumer, discuss about idempotence and avoid getting duplicate messages from the producer. 

## Consumer Advanced 

Consumers are not that easy to implement well when we need to address idempotence and exactly once delivery. 
We are covering more about advance concepts for consumer in [the offset management section](/technology/kafka-consumers/#offset-management). 

## Anatomy of an event-driven microservice

## Adoption Domain Driven Design

## Reactive system

We have introduction and overview of why Reactive Manifesto is important and the supporting technologies, in [this article](/advantages/reactive/).
