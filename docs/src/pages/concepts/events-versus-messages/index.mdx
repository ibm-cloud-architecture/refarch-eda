## Events and Messages

There is a long history of *messaging* in IT systems.  You can easily see an event driven solution and events in the context of messaging systems and messages. However, there are different characteristics that are worth considering:

* **Messaging:** Messages transport a payload and messages are persisted until consumed. Message consumers are typically directly targeted and related to the producer who cares that the message has been delivered and processed.
* **Events:** Events are persisted as a replayable stream history. Event consumers are not tied to the producer. An event is a record of something that has happened and so can't be changed. (You can't change history.)

## Messaging versus event streaming

We recommend reading [this article](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2018/05/18/comparing-messaging-event-streaming-use-cases/) and [this one](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2019/02/05/comparing-messaging-pub-sub-and-event-streams/), to get insight between messaging (focusing on operations / actions to be performed by a system or service) versus event (focusing on the state / facts of a system with no knowledge of the downstream processing. To summarize messaging (like MQ) are to support:

* Transient Data â€“ data is only stored until a consumer has processed the message, or it expires
* Request / reply most of the time
* Targeted reliable delivery: targeted to the entity that will process the request or receive the response. Reliable with transaction support.

For events:

* Stream history: consumers are interested by history and not just the most recent event
* Scalable Consumption: A single event is consumed by many consumers with limited impact as the number of consumers grow.
* Immutable Data.
* Decoupling of Producers and consumers
