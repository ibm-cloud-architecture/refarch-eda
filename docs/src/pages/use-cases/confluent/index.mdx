title: Getting started with Confluent Kafka with OpenShift
description: Getting started with Confluent Kafka with OpenShift
---

In this scenario we're going to do a development deployment of Confluent platform using the Confluent for Kubernetes Operator.
We are using TLS encryption between each components, and configuring different listeners for authentication. We are using

To validate the deployment we will use two simple applications to produce and consume order message.

The integration is using exposing the Kafka bootstrap server with OpenShift routes.


## Prerequisites 

- OC CLI
- helm CLI
- Cluster administrator access to OCP Cluster
- You can clone the eda-lab-inventory repository
 
  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-lab-inventory
  ```

## For sizing 

For production deployment you can use the [eventsizer website](https://eventsizer.io/) to assess the cluster sizing for VM, bare metal or Kubernetes deployment. 

## Installing Confluent for Kubernetes operator

1. Log in to the OpenShift cluster via the CLI first: `oc login ...`
2. Create a new project/namespace to encapsulate the Confluent for Kubernetes resources.

    ```shell
    oc new-project confluent
    ```

> If you change this project name then you need to update the yaml file to define the plaform (See [this example file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-lab-inventory/master/environments/confluent/platform.yaml)).

3. Add the necessary Confluent for Kubernetes helm repository artifacts and update.

    ```shell
    helm repo add confluentinc https://packages.confluent.io/helm
    helm repo update
    ```

4. Install the Operator.

    ```shell
    helm upgrade --install confluent-operator confluentinc/confluent-for-kubernetes
    ```

5. You can wait for the status with the following command

    ```shell
    oc wait deployment confluent-operator --for=condition=Available
    ```

6. Authorize service account to get privileged security context

    **Note** - You should see an error with insufficient security context and that your deployment cannot create a pod. The reason for this is because the associated service account does not have the sufficient permissions to create the pod. Run the following command to get a list of the Service Accounts in the current namespace.

    ```shell
    oc get sa

    NAME                       SECRETS   AGE
    builder                    2         4m11s
    confluent-for-kubernetes   2         3m4s
    default                    2         4m11s
    deployer                   2         4m11s
    pipeline                   2         4m11s
    ```

   As you can see there's the `confluent-for-kubernetes` service account that was automatically created. Run the following command to give that service account the sufficient constraints.

    ```sh
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z confluent-for-kubernetes
    ```
    
    **Note** - Instead of adding the `privileged` security context constraint to the `confluent-for-kubernetes` service account, you may fancy to change the UID (1001) in the Confluent for Kubernetes operator `values.yaml` files instead and applying those custom helm charts.

7. You might need to start a new rollout manually.

   ```shell
   oc rollout latest deployment confluent-operator
   ```


## Deploying Confluent Platform

### Security settings

We're going to be exposing the Kafka service using OpenShift routes which requires TLS configurations for Confluent Platform.

* First of all, we will need to update the `default` Service Account so that the resources can be brought up.

    ```shell
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default
    ```

> **Note** Similar to deploying the Confluent for Kubernetes operator, instead of adding the `privileged` security context constraint to the `default` 
service account, you may fancy to change the UID (1001) required in the helm chart yaml files instead and applying those.

* In the root of [one of our lab repository]() is a folder named `environment/confluent/certs/`. We have defined some sample configurations to use to 
generate our Certificate Authority (CA) keys. **IMPORTANT** - If using another namespace name, the `certs/server-domain.json` file may need to be modified. 
You can replace the `confluen` value with the project/namespace that you have your Confluent for Kubernetes resources located in.

    ```
    "*.confluent.svc.cluster.local",
    "*.zookeeper.confluent.svc.cluster.local",
    "*.kafka.confluent.svc.cluster.local"
    ```

* We will need the [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) CLI tool to sign, vereify and bundle TLS certificates. On MacOS you can use brew to install it.

    ```sh
    brew install cfssl
    ```

* We'll create a new folder `certs/generated/` to keep the CA generated files.

 ```sh
    # under environments/confluent
    mkdir ./certs/generated
    cfssl gencert -initca ./certs/ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ./certs/generated/ca -
 ```

this should creates:

```sh
  ├── generated
  │   ├── ca-key.pem
  │   ├── ca.csr
  │   └── ca.pem
```

* We can validate the CA file with the following.

    ```sh
    openssl x509 -in ./certs/generated/ca.pem -text -noout
    ```

* Now to create server certificates with the appropriate SANs (SANs listed in server-domain.json) we do:

    ```sh
    cfssl gencert -ca=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    -ca-key=./certs/generated/ca-key.pem \
    -config=./certs/ca-config.json \
    -profile=server ./certs/server-domain.json | cfssljson -bare ./certs/generated/server
    ```

  This should add:

```sh
    ├── generated
    |  ├── server-key.pem
    |  ├── server.csr
    |  └── server.pem
```

* Again, we can validate the server certificate and SANs

    ```sh
    openssl x509 -in ./certs/generated/server.pem -text -noout
    ```

* We're going to create eight OpenShift secrets which will all use the same CA files for the sake of simplicity. In production we may is differnet certificate
for each component. They will all be named differently as the TLS configurations within the various Custom Resources expect different TLS secrets. 

    ```sh
    oc create secret generic generic-tls \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem &&
    oc create secret generic kafka-tls-internal \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem &&
    oc create secret generic kafka-tls-external \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem && 
    oc create secret generic zk-tls \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem && 
    oc create secret generic connect-tls \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem &&
    oc create secret generic ksqldb-tls \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem &&
    oc create secret generic controlcenter-tls \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem &&
    oc create secret generic schemaregistry-tls \
    --from-file=fullchain.pem=./certs/generated/server.pem \
    --from-file=cacerts.pem=./certs/generated/ca.pem \
    --from-file=privkey.pem=./certs/generated/server-key.pem 
    ```

* We need to create another secret for the internal Kafka listener so that the other Confluent Platform resources can connect to the Kafka cluster
 over PLAINTEXT.

    ```sh
    oc create secret generic internal-plain-credential \
    --from-file=plain-users.json=./certs/creds-kafka-sasl-users.json \
    --from-file=plain.txt=./certs/creds-client-kafka-sasl-user.txt
    ```

 
### Deploy the platform components form one descriptor


* Get the Openshift ingress subdomain name: 

![Ingress Subdomain](./images/cluster-subdomain.png)

 and update the `environments/confluent/platform.yaml` file to reflect this domain for the route elements:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: platform.confluent.io/v1beta1
  kind: Kafka 
  spec:
    listeners: 
        external:
            externalAccess:
                type: route
                route:
                    domain: <tochange>.....

  # control center
  apiVersion: platform.confluent.io/v1beta1
  kind: ControlCenter
  spec:
    externalAccess:
        type: route
        route:
            domain: <tochange>.
  ```

* Apply the minimum custom resources to get 3 zookeepers, 3 Kafka Broker, 1 Kafka connector, ksqlDB, ControlCenter and schema registry:

    ```shell
    oc apply -f environments/confluent/platform.yaml
    ```

> **Note** - If you created a namespace with a name other than `confluent` you will need to create a local yaml file and you can either remove `metadata.namespace: confluent` 
in each of the Custom Resource YAMLs and apply that file in your created namespace or edit `metadata.namespace: ` value to your created one. 
You can also customize the settings in these YAMLs as you see fit. 
In [this repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-lab-inventory) you will find [such a file](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-lab-inventory/tree/master/environments/confluent/platform.yaml).

* Now wait a few minutes for all the resources to come up.

    ```shell
    oc get pods -w

    NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    confluent-operator-5b4fb58d99-vbnsn   1/1     Running   0          29m
    connect-0                             1/1     Running   2          5m44s
    controlcenter-0                       0/1     Pending   0          108s
    kafka-0                               1/1     Running   0          4m9s
    kafka-1                               1/1     Running   0          4m9s
    kafka-2                               1/1     Running   0          4m9s
    ksqldb-0                              0/1     Pending   0          109s
    schemaregistry-0                      1/1     Running   0          109s
    zookeeper-0                           1/1     Running   0          5m44s
    zookeeper-1                           1/1     Running   0          5m44s
    zookeeper-2                           1/1     Running   0          5m44s
    ```

* Once everything is ready you can test by port-forwarding to `controlcenter-0` pod.

    ```shell
    oc port-forward controlcenter-0 9021:9021
    ```

    Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9021 -> 9021
    Forwarding from [::1]:9021 -> 9021
    Handling connection for 9021

* In your browser go to `localhost:9021`.

    ![Confluent Control Center](./images/confluent-control-center.png)


## Add topics

Create the `KafkaTopic` custom resource anemd `orders`.

```sh
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: platform.confluent.io/v1beta1
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: orders
  namespace: confluent
spec:
  replicas: 3
  partitionCount: 1
  configs:
    cleanup.policy: "delete"
EOF

```

## Validate deployment by access control center user interface

Once everything is up and running you can verify the Control center using a port forward like before.

```shell
oc port-forward control-center-0 9021:9021
```

* Go to `https://localhost:9021`. The `https` is important unlike previously as it's now secured.

You can also view the Control Center UI from the enabled route which will be in the form of something like the following
`cc-route......containers.appdomain.cloud`
