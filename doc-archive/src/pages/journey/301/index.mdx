## Security review - RBAC
## Producer advanced

In [this section](/technology/kafka-producers/#advanced-producer-discussion), we address how to support exactly once delivery
between producer and consumer, discuss about idempotence and avoid getting duplicate messages from the producer. 

## Consumer Advanced 

Consumers are not that easy to implement well when we need to address idempotence and exactly once delivery. 
We are covering more about advance concepts for consumer in [the offset management section](/technology/kafka-consumers/#offset-management). 

## Anatomy of an event-driven microservice

## Adoption Domain Driven Design

## Reactive system

We have introduction and overview of why Reactive Manifesto is important and the supporting technologies, in [this article](/advantages/reactive/).

## Learn more abour schema registry
## Always-On
## Monitoring
## Governance 

## Deployment with GitOps practices

## Deploying a Kafka Connect Confluent MQ connector with SSL security to MQ

Here there is the `eda-lab-mq-to-kafka` [repository](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-lab-mq-to-kafka) which goes into all the configuration and steps that need to be 
done to connect Kafka Connect to MQ on the Confluent platform.
