  once started a table should be displayed to present the records sent to Kafka. 

1. Let assess if we can see the item stock cross stores: use the item-aggregator route, something like ` item-aggregator-rt-inventory.dte-ocp46-73awfj-915b3b336cabec458a7c7ec2aa7c625f-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud ` but completed with '/q/swagger-ui' as we want to access the API
  
  To get this route use the following command:

  ```sh
  oc get routes item-aggregator -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}" && echo
  ```

   Select the get `/api/v1/items/{itemID}` operation:

  ![](./images/items-stock-req.png)

  Use one of the following item id: [Item_1, Item_2, Item_3, Item_4, Item_5, Item_6, Item_7]. You should get 
  the current stock cross stores

1. Let assess a store stock, for that we access the store aggregator URL: `store-aggregator-rt-inventory.dte-ocp46-73awfj-915b3b336cabec458a7c7ec2aa7c625f-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud ` with the `/q/swagger-ui` suffix.

  To get this route use the following command:

  ```sh
  oc get routes store-aggregator -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}" && echo
  ```

  Then use the GET on the `api/v1/stores/inventory/{storeID}`, and enter one of the available store: `[Store_1, Store_2, Store_3, Store_4, Store_5]`
