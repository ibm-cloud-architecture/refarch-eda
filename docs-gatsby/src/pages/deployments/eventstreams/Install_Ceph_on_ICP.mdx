description: Install and configure Ceph for IBM Cloud Private
---

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is open source software designed to provide highly scalable object, block and file-based storage under a unified system.

Ceph provides a POSIX-compliant network file system (CephFS) that aims for high performance, large data storage, and maximum compatibility with legacy applications.

[Rook](https://github.com/rook/rook) is an open source orchestrator for distributed storage systems running in cloud native environments.

Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Rook uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

!!! note
    The Helm chart *ibm-rook-rbd-cluster* is used for setting up Ceph Cluster in IBM Cloud Private.   

## Environment

A typical IBM Cloud Private Environment includes Boot node, Master node, Management node, Proxy node and Worker nodes. When the Ceph RBD Cluster is used for providing storage for API Connect, any three worker nodes should be configured to have additional raw disks.

The following set of systems can be used as reference for building *development (non-HA) environment* that runs IBM API Connect workload on IBM Cloud Private.

| Node type | Number of nodes | CPU | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|	Boot (FTP Server) | 1	| 8	| 32 | 2048 |
|	Master	| 1	| 8	| 32 | 300 |
|	Management | 1	| 8	| 32 | 300 |
|	Proxy	| 1	| 4	| 16 | 300 |
|	Worker | 3 | 8 | 32	| 300+500(disk2)|
|	Total |	7 | 52 | 208 | 3848+1500(disk2) |

The following set of systems can be used as reference for building *production (HA) environment* that runs IBM API Connect workload on IBM Cloud Private.

| Node type | Number of nodes | CPU | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|	Boot (FTP Server)	| 1	| 8	| 32 | 2048 |
|	Master	| 3	| 8	| 32 | 300 |
|	Management | 2	| 8	| 32 | 300 |
|	Proxy	| 3	| 4	| 16 | 300 |
|	Worker  | 3 | 16 | 64 | 300+750(disk2)|
|	Total |	12	| 108| 432 | 5348+2250(disk2) |

!!! note
    Additional worker nodes will be required when there is a a need to run workloads other than IBM API Connect on IBM Cloud Private.

## Setup

This document covers the setup of *Ceph* storage using *Rook*.

The following tasks are performed for setting up the Ceph Cluster. 

1. [Download the required setup files](#1-download-the-required-setup-files)
2. [Logon to IBM Cloud Private Cluster](#2-logon-to-ibm-cloud-private-cluster)

### 2. Logon to IBM Cloud Private Cluster

The script [login.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/scripts/icp/login.sh) can be run to login to IBM Cloud Private Cluster. 

!! note
    The script should be updated to include the correct value for *CLUSTER_NAME*.

Sample run of the login script is as follows: 

![](./images/loginToDefaultNamespace.png)


### 3. Setup Ceph Cluster 

**Step #1** Update the [ceph-values.yaml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/ceph-values.yaml) to match your environment.

The file *ceph-values.yaml* needs to be updated to list the IP address of the storage node within the IBM Cloud Private cluster. 

```
...
#
# UPDATE VARIABLES TO MATCH THE ENVIRONMENT
#   
    nodes:
    - name: "X.X.X.X"
      devices:
      - name: "DISK_NAME"
    - name: "Y.Y.Y.Y"
      devices:
      - name: "DISK_NAME"
    - name: "Z.Z.Z.Z"
      devices:
      - name: "DISK_NAME"
...
...
```

**Step #2** Modify and run the setup script to install Rook Operator chart and the IBM Rook RBD Cluster chart

The contents of the script [setup.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/setup.sh) is as follows: 

```
#
# UPDATE VARIABLES TO MATCH THE ENVIRONMENT
#

# Define the location of images 
IMAGE_DIR=/DIRECTORY_HAVING_IMAGES

...
```

!!! note
    The script should be updated to include the correct location for *IMAGE_DIR* that has the location where the chart ibm-rook-rbd-cluster-0.8.3.tgz is downloaded and unzipped. 

The output of Ceph install is listed below for reference: 
 
- [ceph_install.log](./samples/ceph_install.log)


### 4. Verify Ceph cluster

The script [status.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/status.sh) can be run to check if Ceph cluster is working as expected. 

The contents of the script [status.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/status.sh) is as follows: 

```
./deployments/ceph/status.sh 
``` 

Expected output is listed below.

### 5. Troubleshooting Ceph setup

#### 5.1 Steps for reseting an used disk 

It is possible that sometimes OSD pods does't start up even though the OSD prepare jobs have completed successfully. 
It could happen when the device you have specified does not have a raw disk and the device name you have listed was used for other storage like GlusterFS cluster.

In such case the following commands can be run to collect the Logical Volume group ID and Physical volume and remove it fully so that the raw disk is made available for the Ceph cluster.

```
pvs
pvdisplay
vgremove LOGIOCAL_VOLUME_GROUP_ID -y 
pvremove PHYSICAL_VOLUME
```

The output of the aforesaid commands is listed below.

```
[root@rsun-rhel-glusterfs03 ~]# pvs

[root@rsun-rhel-glusterfs03 ~]# pvremove /dev/sdb 
  Labels on physical volume "/dev/sdb" successfully wiped.
```

#### 5.2 Steps for uninstalling the rook-ceph setup 

**Step #1** The script [cleanup.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/cleanup.sh) can be run to remove the Ceph setup completely.

```
./deployments/ceph/cleanup.sh
``` 

**Step #2** Remove the contents of the temporary directory used by rook: */var/lib/rook*

The following command should run on all the worker nodes: 

```
rm -fr /var/lib/rook
```

The *Ceph Monitor* pod can be attached using the following command:

```
kubectl -n rook-ceph exec -it $(kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod -l "app=rook-ceph-mon" -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') bash
```

After being attached to the *Ceph Monitor* pod, the following commands can be run which provides status and statistics of the *Ceph Cluster*.

```
ceph health 
ceph status 
ceph df 
ceph osd stat
ceph osd tree
ceph osd df 
ceph osd df tree
